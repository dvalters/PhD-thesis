%\section{Intro}
%In landscapes where fluvial processes are the dominant mechanism of sediment erosion and transport, several models of fluvial incision have been proposed that parameterise hydro-meteorological conditions -- the transfer of water from the lower atmosphere to the land surface. Such models include the representation of rainfall input as discrete storm events, e.g. the Poisson pulse model of rainfall input (Tucker and Bras, 2000), models that incorporate the role of limited storm duration relative to runoff-time across the catchment (Solyom and Tucker, 2004), and the nature of orographic precipitation gradients the rainfall-runoff-erosion process (e.g. Anders and Roe, 2006; Han and Gasparini 2015). 
%
%
%\section{Hypothesis (mathematical model)}
%
%\textbf{In short}: Rate of fluvial incision is dependent storm size, depth, and position of storm cell relative to the catchment. This applies to large catchments or small storm cells, where the ratio of storm coverage to total catchment size is less than one. 
%
%\subsection{Catchment hydrology with limited storm cell sizes}
%For large catchments, or for small storm cells, the area of rainfall input, here termed the catchment wetted area, will be less than the total catchment drainage area. (See figure 1). This is denoted by the ratio: \(A_w/A\), where \(A_w\) is the wetted area. 
%
%%\begin{figure}
%%\label{stormcellbasin}
%%%\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{drawing.png}
%%\caption{Two scenarios in the limited area storm model, both with storm cell areal coverage less than the total basin area. Storm wetted area \(A_{wa} \approx A_{wb}\). a) Storm cell centred far from catchment outlet point, ratio of wetted flow runoff length to max basin length, \(L_w/L\), is near 1. b) Storm cell centred close to outlet point, \(L_w\) is short relative to basin total length. The implications on peak discharge, and thus erosion rates, are discussed within the text.}
%%\end{figure}
%
%Given a catchment with a smaller contributing storm cell, there can be variability in the positioning of the storm relative to the catchment outlet point. This spatial variation in storm cell positioning will influence the storm hydrograph for each storm event. The total storm hydrograph time, \(T_h\) can be given by:
%
%\begin{equation}
%T_h = T_r + T_t
%\end{equation}
%
%Where \(T_r\) is the storm duration time, and \(T_t\) is the total runoff travel time from the most distant wetted point in the catchment to the outlet. The total runoff travel time is given by:
%
%\begin{equation}
%T_t = L_w/U_f
%\end{equation}
%
%where \( L_w \) is the longest wetted flow routing path in the catchment, \(U_f\) is the flow routing velocity, assumed to be approximately spatially constant. 
%
%\subsection{Deriving an approximation for discharge in storm-size limited catchments} 
%Solyom and Tucker (2004) note that similar derivations for peak discharge approximation are needed for environments where storm size is limited relative to catchment area, so I use their equations as a starting point. 
%
%Starting with the simple case of Hortonian (infiltration excess) overland flow, the discharge at a point in the river channel can be given by:
%
%\begin{equation}
%Q = (R - I)A_w
%\end{equation}
%where R is rainfall rate, I is infiltration rate, and \(A_w\) is the upstream wetted drainage area. The total volume of water in a given storm is stated as:
%
%\begin{equation}
%V = (R - I)A_w T_r
%\end{equation}
%
%where \(T_r\) is the storm duration time. As per Solyom and Tucker (2004) the total flood hydrograph volume can be written as:
%
%\begin{equation}
%V = \int_{0}^{T_h} Q(t) dt
%\end{equation}
%
%The hydrograph can be non-dimensionalised by scaling with peak flow, \(Q_p\), and time can be normalised by the total flood hydrograph duration, \(T_h\) (after Willgose, 1989):
%
%\begin{equation}
%Q'(t') = Q(t)/Q_p
%\end{equation}
%where
%\begin{equation}
%t' = t/T_h
%\end{equation}
%
%Then the non-dimensionalised flood-hydrograph volume can be written as such:
%
%\begin{equation}
%V = Q_p T_h \int_{0}^{1} Q'(t') dt'
%\end{equation}
%
%Assuming constant rainfall, \(R\), and infiltration rates, \(I\), peak discharge can be written as a function of runoff rate, storm duration, storm wetted area, and wetted flow route length:
%
%
%%\begin{equation}
%\begin{align}
%\label{peakdischarge}
%Q_p &= \frac{V}{T_h \int_{0}^{1} Q'(t') dt'} \
%    &= \frac{1}{T_h} \frac{(R-I) A_w T_r}{F_{hs}} \
%    &= \frac{(R-I)A_w}{F_{hs}} \frac{T_r}{T_r + L_w/U_f} 
%\end{align}
%%\end{equation}
%
%where \(F_{hs}\) is a hydrograph `shape-factor' equal to the integral in equation (8). \(F_{hs}\) goes to one for steady state run off conditions (i.e. a flat or rectangular hydrograph)
% 
%According to equation \ref{peakdischarge}, peak discharge will vary according to the catchment wetted area to wetted flow runoff length ratio, \(A_w/L_w\), and the ratio of storm duration, \(T_r\), to the total hydrograph duration. Also note that \(A_w\) and \(L_w\) are not independent of each other, and increasing \(A_w\) can increase \(L_w\). (This is not true in the Solyom and Tucker (2004) application of this equation as rainfall is assumed to spatially uniform over the total catchment area.)
%
%\subsection{Assumptions}
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Storm cell is stationary (does not track across the basin for the duration of the storm)
%\item Storm cell is a single cell. (i.e. not multiple cells scattered across the basin)
%\item Flow routing velocity is uniform. (Not entirely true assumption, routing time is slower on hillslopes, but the effect can be ignored if drainage density is relatively uniform (Solyom and Tucker (2004)).
%\item Rainfall rate and infiltration rate constant for duration of storm.
%\item Simple infiltration-excess (Hortonian) hydrological state.
%
%\end{itemize}
%It may be possible to modify the model to account for one or more of these assumptions.
%
%
%\subsection{Fluvial erosion}
%(Deriving a similar expression for fluvial incision in a detachment-limited environment here, incorporating the above non-steady discharge approximations for limited storm-area cases) 

%The rate of incision at any given point in a fluvial, bedrock channel is typically given as a function of excess shear stress, that is to say a certain threshold of shear stress exerted by the fluid flow of a river must be exceeded to detach bedrock material (Howard and Kerby, xxxx):

%\begin{equation}
%\epsilon = K_e(\tau - {\tau}_c)^\gamma
%\end{equation}
%
%where shear stress, \({\tau}_c \) and critical shear stress, \( {\tau}_c \), are given by a function of the local discharge \(q\), channel gradient, \(S\) and a shear stress coefficient, \(K_t\).
%
%Traditional models of fluvial incision typically consider discharge at any given point on the landscape as a function of local channel gradient and upstream constributing drainage area, such as the simple stream power law equation for fluvial incision in bedrock channels;
%
%\begin{equation}
%E = 
%\end{equation}

%\textit{It would be nice to look at this if there was time (there probably won't be though!) I had a rough framework sketched out and partially implemented for how this would be done using CHILD and WRF together. Maybe one for the future instead.
