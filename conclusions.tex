\chapter{Conclusions}

The spatial resolution of rainfall input in a river catchment simulation has a demonstrable effect on both hydrological and sediment fluxes, which is seen in both catchment-wide fluxes (Figures \ref{fig_boscastle_hydrograph_ensemble}, \ref{fig_boscastle_sedigraph_ensemble}, \ref{fig_ryedale_hydrograph_ensemble}, \ref{fig_ryedale_sedigraph_ensemble}). Though the magnitude of the sensitivity varied between experiments, there was a general increase in water fluxes, and hence sediment flux, in simulations with gridded rainfall data used as the rainfall input, compared to simulations that used a single, uniform value for rainfall. Existing studies investigating landscape evolution model sensitivity to rainfall resolution \citep{coulthard2016sensitivity} have noted similar increases in water discharge and sediment yields when using spatially heterogeneous rainfall data. The results from the experiments presented in this chapter are broadly in agreement with the general findings of \citet{coulthard2016sensitivity} although the timescales involved in each study are of different magnitudes. The results presented here suggest that the effect of rainfall resolution sensitivity applies to hydrogeomorphic processes at the single-event time scale, as well as landscape evolution over periods of hundreds and thousands of years.
