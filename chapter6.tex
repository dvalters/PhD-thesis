%Landscapes evolve and take their shape from the cumulative effect of `geomorphically effective' events. In temperate climates, these are rainfall-driven events of sufficient magnitude to trigger threshold-dependent erosional processes. This chapter investigates the sensitivity of two end-member erosional models to the spatial resolution of rainfall input to a catchment using three historic severe rainfall events in Northern England and Cornwall.

%It is demonstrated that the erosional model chosen exerts first-order control of the total amount of landscape change and sediment flux. However, both end member models show sensitivity to the spatial resolution of rainfall input data during individual, formative rainfall events.

\section{Introduction}

Flooding from intense rainfall poses great risk to communities living in proximity to flood-prone areas and has the potential to cause loss of life and substantial economic damage in affected areas \citep{pitt2008pitt}. Reliable prediction and advanced warning of flooding requires an understanding of the hydrological processes that operate within a river catchment, in order that operational flood forecasting models may be better parameterised and developed to mitigate against the impact of future events. The interaction of environmental processes within the river catchment system is sensitive to a number of external and internal forcings, including but not limited to precipitation input \citep{nicotina2008impact}, catchment vegetation cover (XXXX), preconditioning of the catchment water table and soil moisture store by antecedent conditions, urbanisation, debris mobilisation and blockage in river channels, as well as channel morphological change during flood events. 

Morphological change during flood events has been shown to be a potential control in the extent of flooding during intense rainfall \citep{wong2015sensitivity}, particularly when river channels undergo geomorphically rapid change during repeated rainfall events of high magnitude \citep{slater2016extent}.. 

Growing consensus indicates that intense rainfall events are becoming more frequent in the UK \citep{kendon2014heavier}.

Patterns of rainfall distribution across a catchment can affect hydrograph response, including the peak discharge and local water levels (Nicotina et al., 2008). As many geomorphic processes are threshold dependent (Schumm, 1979), such as fluvial incision into bedrock (Sklar and Dietrich, 2001; Snyder et al., 2003), there is potential for the spatial distribution of rainfall to control local erosion rates within a catchment. Non-linearity in geomorphic process laws (e.g. Coulthard et al., 1998; Phillips, 2003; Coulthard and Van de Wiel, 2007) should dictate that catchments are also geomorphically sensitive to the spatial distribution of rainfall. 

The following questions are explored through the use of numerical modelling simulations;

\begin{itemize}
\item Are predicted flood inundation extents during a storm sensitive to the spatial resolution of rainfall inputs to the catchment?
\item Are fluvial erosion and sediment transport processes controls on predicted flood inundation extents in a catchment during a single severe storm.
\item Does geomorphic change of the floodplain and channel during a storm event significant enough to affect flood inundation predictions?
\end{itemize}

\section{Experiment Design \& Method}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
An ensemble of simulations was designed to address the questions laid out in the previous section. The simulations were parametrised with different erosion law schemes and different rainfall input resolutions to assess which environmental factors exerted the greatest control over catchment response to intense rainfall, in terms of flood inundation and sediment transport. The same ensemble of experiments was carried out for two historic rainfall events that lead to severe flooding in UK river catchments. The summary of the ensemble events is given in the table below:

The numerical landscape evolution model, HAIL-CAESAR (described in Chapter \ref{chapter_HAIL-CAESAR}) is used to investigate landscape and hydrological response to varying rainfall input resolution. HAIL-CAESAR is a hydrodynamic landscape evolution model that uses a TOPMODEL-based hydrological rainfall-runoff model to generate surface runoff in a river catchment, which is then routed through the landscape according to an adaptation of the LISFLOOD-FP shallow water routing algorithms \citep{bates2010simple}. Fluvial erosion and sediment transport is then derived using the velocities and depths of the calculated surface water within the catchment. The equations describing the water routing, sediment erosion, and transport laws are described fully in Chapter \ref{chapter_HAIL-CAESAR}.


%\subsection{Rainfall-runoff and flow routing}
%From rainfall input, runoff is calculated using an adaptation of the Beven and Kirby (1979) TOPMODEL. Total surface and subsurface discharge is given by:
%
%\begin{equation}
%Q_{tot} = \frac{m}{T}\log \left( \frac{(r - j_t) + j_t \exp \left( \frac{rT}{m} \right) }{r} \right)
%\end{equation}
%
%where \(T\) is the time step in seconds, \(r\) is the rainfall rate, \(j_t\) is a function that describes soil moisture store, and \(m\) is a parameter that controls the rise and fall of this soil moisture store in \(j_t\). These adapted TOPMODEL equations are given fully in Coulthard (2002), equations (1) and (2).
%
%The amount of water partitioned between surface and subsurface flow is determined by a simple infiltration threshold, given by:
%
%\begin{equation}
%I_t = KS(Dx)^2
%\end{equation}
%
%where \(K\) is hydraulic conductivity, \(S\) is the slope, and \(Dx\) is the width of the grid cell or horizontal grid spacing. The infiltration threshold is subtracted from \(Q_{tot}\) to give the portion of water routed over the surface.
%
%Surface water and channel flow is an important driver in catchment scale erosional processes. The amount and velocity of water flow is a variable in both the sediment transport and bedrock erosion laws. The water flow equations are based on a simplified form of the shallow water flow equations, a simplification first derived by Bates (2010) and incorporated into the landscape evolution model by Coulthard et al (2013). The flow between cells is calculated by:
%
%\begin{equation}
%Q = \frac{q - g h_{flow} \Delta T \frac{\Delta (h+z) }{\Delta x}}{1 + g h_{flow} \Delta t n^2 |q| / h_{flow}^{10/3}} \Delta x
%\end{equation}
%
%where \(q\) is the water flux between cells from the previous iteration, \(g\) is acceleration due to gravity, \(h_{flow}\) is the maximum depth of flow between cells (m), \(t\) is time (s), \(h\) is depth of water, \(z\) is elevation, \(x\) is the grid well width, and \(n\) is Manning's roughness coefficient. The full implementation details are given in Coulthard (2013), and the derivation from the shallow water equations is given in Bates (2010).
%
%\subsection{Sediment transport}
%Transport of loose sediment within the model is governed by the \citet{Wilcock2003} sediment transport model. The Wilcock and Crowe model represents transport of mixed sand/gravel fractions based on the surface sediment composition. The rate of sediment transport, \(q_i\), is given as:
%
%\begin{equation}
%q_i = \frac{F_i {U_*}^3 {W_i}^*}{(s -1) g}
%\end{equation}
%
%where \(F_i\) is the fractional volume of sediment, for a given sediment fraction, \(i\), \(U^*\) is the shear velocity, \(s\) is the ratio of sediment to water density. \({W_i}^*\) is a function relating fractional transport rate to total transport rate (see \citet{Wilcock2003} for a full derivation of this equation). The usage of this sediment transport model is extrapolated here to account for finer particles such as silts \citep{Vandewiel2007}, as well as the sand-gravel mixture it was originally designed for.
%
%\subsection{Bedrock incision}
%\label{bedrock_model}
%A simple model of bedrock incision based on the excess shear stress model (Citations) is implemented in the numerical model. The rate of bedrock incision is determined by the amount of shear stress acting on the bedrock, above a threshold level of stress required to initiate substrate removal (e.g. \citet{Snyder2003}. When bedrock material is removed, it is distributed amongst the sediment fractions according to the fractional proportions set by the user. The rate of bedrock erosion according to the excess shear stress model is given by:
%
%\begin{equation}
%\varepsilon = k_e(\tau_b - \tau_c)^{P_b}
%\end{equation}
%
%where \(k_e\) is the bedrock erodibility coefficient, \(\tau_b\) is the basal shear stress on the channel bed, \(\tau_c\), is the critical shear stress threshold, \(P_b\) is the shear stress exponent. (Cite Howard or Whipple?)

%\subsubsection{Overview}

\section{Sensitivity analysis}
There are numerous user defined parameters in the HAIL-CAESAR model, and in landscape evolution models in general, that have a wide range of potential values. Parameter selection in environmental modelling comes with a degree of uncertainty, and resulting outputs from models can be highly sensitive to the user's choice of input parameters for a given simulation \citep{Pelletier2012}. Initial testing of the HAIL-CAESAR model, and studies using the CAESAR-Lisflood model that it is based upon show it is particularly sensitive to the TOPMODEL \textit{m} parameter, a parameter that controls the rise and fall of the soil moisture store, and hence how a river catchment responds to rainfall input \citep{beven1979physically}. 

To assess the sensitivity of the model to the choice of TOPMODEL-\textit{m} parameter, a series of simulations were carried out with a range of \textit{m} values for both test cases. Simulations of each flood event were carried out with the \textit{m} values shown in table \ref{table-m-sens}.

\section{Results}

\subsection{TOPMODEL sensitivity}

The model exhibited a strong sensitivity to the choice of the TOPMODEL \( m\) parameter. In the results presented in figure \ref{fig_topmodel_m_ryedale} peak river discharge ranged from XX at an \(m\) value of 0.003 to XX with an \(m\) value of 0.008. The measured peak discharge reported for the 2005 storm at the Ness gauging station was 105 cumecs. In the sensitivity simulations, a value of \(m = 0.005\) produced a flood peak most closely matching the observed value, peaking at XX cumecs (Note the time as well.). 

There were differences between the hydrographs of the observed and simulated discharges in terms of peak discharge timing and recession limb shape. The observed hydrograph showed a sharp rise at around 50 hours after the start of the simulation period. (UTC XX XX XX to X). Lower \(m\) values (m \textless 0.005) resulted in a prediction of the flood peak being too early compared to the observed timing, with values \textgreater \ 0.005 predicting the flood peak timing too late. Most of the simulations failed to capture the extended duration of peak discharge, which lasted approximately 5--6 hours, before receding back to low flow levels. The simulation with \(m = 0.006\) came closest to predicting this hydrograph shape, but failed to predict the magnitude of water discharge correctly, underestimating the peak flow by almost 50\%. 

For Ryedale simulations, it was decided to use an \(m\) value of 0.005, providing the closest possible match to the flood peak discharge, though not the true shape of the hydrograph and the receeding limb. As the catchment simulations include a representation of erosion and sediment transport processes, which are often threshold dependent, it was felt necessary to match the discharge peak more closely over choosing to match the hydrograph shape precisely.

\subsection{Catchment hydrology}

%Comparisons with the actual hydrographs from the gauged basins?

At the catchment scale, hydrological response was sensitive to both the rainfall resolution and the choice of erosional model. For both catchments, higher resolution rainfall input data resulted in a greater maximum river discharge. In the Ryedale experiments, simulations using the gridded rainfall input experienced a flashier hydrological response, reaching peak discharge several hours before the uniform rainfall input cases. This was not observed in any of the Boscastle simulations, with all simulations reaching peak discharge within 30 minutes of each other.

The choice of erosion model also influenced the hydrological response. When catchment erosion was modelled using a transport-limited case, peak discharges were higher in all cases, but the timing of hydrograph peaks remained similar for each case. The difference in peak discharges were minimal when comparing the detachment-limited cases to the hydrological-only models.

\end{figure}



\subsection{Spatial variation in flood inundation}
\subsubsection{Boscastle}
The Boscastle catchment simulations showed minimal variation in flood inundation extent. Simulations with gridded rainfall input did not result in substantially different predictions of floodwater inundation compared to those with uniform rainfall input. Both sets of simulations reflected the general extent of reported flood water extents \citep{wallingford2005flooding}. Simulations that allowed erosion to take place (GRID\_TLIM and UNIFORM\_TLIM) showed a slight difference in the variation of floodwater depths in the floodplain area, particularly in the vicinity of Boscastle village, where Figure \ref{fig_boscastle_2dplan_flood_ensemble} is centred on. In hydrological-only simulations, the deepest water depths were predicted to occur in the confines of the river channel, whereas in erosion-enabled simulation, there appeared to be a `smoothing' effect of water depths between the channel and the adjacent floodplain, suggesting that the channel geometry had altered during the flood event either by infilling from sediment from upstream or collapse of the adjacent river banks. Engineer's reports of the Boscastle flood noted that the river channel in the Boscastle village area had indeed been inundated with debris during the storm, which had potentially contributed to the extent of the flooding within the village.

\subsubsection{Ryedale}
The Ryedale simulations showed greater variation in flood extent between the gridded rainfall and uniform rainfall inputs. The flood extents were greater in the gridded rainfall input simulations, corresponding with the higher peak discharges predicted in these simulations.  The variation in water depths appeared to be less sensitive in comparison to the Boscastle simulations. In the lower reaches of the catchment (Figure \ref{fig_ryedale_2dplan_flood_ensemble}, there appeared to be little indication that flood extents or water depths were sensitive to the erosion parameterisation, in contrast to the Boscastle simulations.

\section{Discussion}

The size of the two catchments appears to be a determining factor in how sensitive hydrogeomorphic processes are to the rainfall data input resolution. The Boscastle catchment at 18 km\(^2\) is approximately an order of magnitude smaller than the Rydedale catchment at 270 km\(^2\). For each simulation using gridded rainfall input, the cell width of the rainfall grid is 1 km. The relative amount of increase in rainfall detail between uniform and gridded simulations is much greater in the larger Ryedale catchment than the Boscastle catchment. By using a 1 km gridded rainfall product as input data, the Ryedale simulation potentially captures 15 times more rainfall heterogeneity compared to the respective Boscastle simulation, by virtue of it simply being a much larger catchment with a greater number of rainfall input cells. Catchment size is known to be a factor in hydrological studies of rainfall resolution, and larger catchments are reported to show greater sensitivity to rainfall resolution \citep[e.g.][]{nicotina2008impact}, in terms of hydrological response.

Increasing the resolution of rainfall input data may not be enough to observe sensitivity in smaller catchments, as rainfall features themselves may not exhibit the necessary heterogeneity in structure to benefit from being resolved at finer scale. Rain cells or bands equal to or greater in size than the catchment over which they rain upon, may well be homogeneous enough in spatial extent and rainfall rate that a `uniform' approximation of their rainfall rate is sufficiently precise enough to represent the rainfall rate at all points in the catchment. As seen in the Boscastle catchment simulations, using a detailed rainfall input data source did not notably alter the outcome of the hydrological predictions (Figures \ref{fig_boscastle_2dplan_flood_ensemble}, \ref{fig_ryedale_2dplan_flood_ensemble}). In the Ryedale catchment simulations, the hydrological predictions were notably different based on the choice of rainfall input data resolution, affecting both the time and magnitude of the resulting flood peak. 

Talk about size of convective cell features. What is typical storm cell size and heterogeneity (decay from centre?).

Catchment hydrological response on the short term scale -- such as during the course of single storm event -- is also sensitive the spatial input pattern of rainfall, with the simulations carried out in this study also supporting similar work of \citep{nicotina2008impact} AND OTHERS.
