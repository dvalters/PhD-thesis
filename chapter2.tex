\chapter{Modelling landscape evolution}
\label{LEMs}
\textit{This is a general overview of landscape evolution models and the key concepts and limitations they have. }

\textit{In the next chapter, Chapter 3, there is a more focused review of the specific area of Landscape evolution models that I am working on -- i.e. rainfall representation in LEMs. I only touch upon rainfall parametrisation here.}

This chapter could be based on the \textit{Geomorphological Techniques} book chapter (Valters, 2016).
